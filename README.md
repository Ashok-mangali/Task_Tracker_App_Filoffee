I built a simple React app to manage daily tasks using React.js.

Create a new project using a React.js application by running: 
1. Use the command: `npx create-react-app tracker-app` to create a new React application named "tracker-app."
   
To begin the project, I follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the tracker-app directory:
   ```
   cd tracker-app
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
